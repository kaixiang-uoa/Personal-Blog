## Next Steps

### Step 1: Frontend CI/CD Configuration and Automated Deployment (New)

#### Phase 1: Frontend Project Local Preparation
- [x] Add and configure Prettier
  - [x] Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev prettier eslint-config-prettier
    ```
  - [x] Create .prettierrc.json configuration file:
    ```json
    {
      "semi": true,
      "singleQuote": true,
      "tabWidth": 2,
      "printWidth": 100,
      "trailingComma": "es5"
    }
    ```
  - [x] Update ESLint configuration to integrate Prettier
  - [x] Add npm scripts:
    ```json
    {
      "format": "prettier --write .",
      "lint": "eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx"
    }
    ```
- [x] Ensure TypeScript check configuration is correct
  - [x] Check tsconfig.json configuration
  - [x] Verify type checking commands
  - [x] Add type checking to CI process
- [ ] Consider adding unit testing framework (optional)
  - [ ] Install Jest and React Testing Library
  - [ ] Configure testing environment
  - [ ] Add example test cases

#### Phase 2: Configure GitHub Actions Automated Workflow
- [x] Create .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml file
- [x] Configure automated process:
  - [x] Code checkout
  - [x] Node.js environment setup
  - [x] Dependency installation
  - [x] Code quality checks:
    - [x] ESLint check
    - [x] Prettier formatting check
    - [x] TypeScript type check
  - [x] Project build
  - [x] Deployment to Vercel
- [x] Add additional quality checks:
  - [x] Dependency security check (npm audit)
  - [x] Build size check
  - [x] Performance budget check
  - [x] Code coverage report (if tests are added)

#### Phase 3: Configure GitHub Secrets and Vercel
- [x] Set up GitHub Secrets:
  - [x] VERCEL_TOKEN (obtained from Vercel account)
  - [x] VERCEL_ORG_ID (obtained from Vercel project settings)
  - [x] VERCEL_PROJECT_ID (obtained from Vercel project settings)
- [x] Create vercel.json configuration file:
  ```json
  {
    "version": 2,
    "buildCommand": "npm run build",
    "outputDirectory": ".next",
    "framework": "nextjs",
    "regions": ["hkg1"],
    "env": {
      "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL": "@next_public_api_url"
    }
  }
  ```
- [x] Set up Vercel project:
  - [x] Create new project
  - [x] Configure build settings
  - [x] Set environment variables
  - [x] Configure custom domain (optional)

#### Phase 4: Testing and Verification
- [ ] Create test branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b dev
  ```
- [ ] Push code to test CI/CD process:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "feat: add CI/CD pipeline"
  git push origin dev
  ```
- [ ] Verify deployment results:
  - [ ] Check GitHub Actions execution status
  - [ ] Confirm Vercel deployment site availability
  - [ ] Verify all functionality works correctly
- [ ] Monitor and optimize:
  - [ ] Check build time
  - [ ] Analyze deployment logs
  - [ ] Optimize CI/CD process

### Step 2: Security Enhancement (Step 5)

Recommended security measures:

1. **API Security**
   - ✅ Implement request rate limiting (already implemented in contact form API)
   - [ ] Add CSRF protection
   - ✅ Implement request validation and sanitization (partially implemented in contact form API)

2. **Data Security**
   - [ ] Ensure sensitive data is encrypted in storage
   - [ ] Implement data backup strategy
   - [ ] Add data validation and sanitization

3. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - ✅ Strengthen password policy (implemented in authController.js)
   - [ ] Implement multi-factor authentication (if needed)
   - [ ] Complete permission control system

4. **Server Security**
   - [ ] Configure appropriate CORS policy
   - [ ] Set secure HTTP headers
   - [ ] Disable unnecessary services and ports

5. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - ✅ Implement security logging (implemented in errorMiddleware.js)
   - [ ] Set up anomaly monitoring and alerts

### Step 3: Deployment Preparation (Step 4)

After completing security enhancements, prepare for deployment:

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - [ ] Prepare production environment configuration files
   - [ ] Set environment variables
   - [ ] Configure domain and SSL certificate

2. **Database Preparation**
   - [ ] Prepare database migration scripts
   - [ ] Set up database backup strategy

3. **Deployment Process**
   - [ ] Choose appropriate deployment platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS)
   - [ ] Configure CI/CD process
   - [ ] Set up monitoring and logging system

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - [ ] Implement code splitting and lazy loading
   - [ ] Configure caching strategy
   - [ ] Optimize static resources

## Current Priorities

1. Complete frontend CI/CD configuration and automated deployment
   - Prioritize completing Phase 1's Prettier configuration
   - Then configure GitHub Actions
   - Finally set up Vercel deployment
2. Implement security enhancements
3. Prepare for formal deployment

## Suggestions and Notes

1. **Branch Strategy**
   - Use `main` as production branch
   - Use `dev` as development branch
   - Use `feature/*` for feature branches
   - Use `hotfix/*` for emergency fix branches

2. **Code Review**
   - Set up Pull Request template
   - Require at least one code review
   - Ensure all checks pass before merging

3. **Monitoring and Alerts**
   - Set up build failure notifications
   - Monitor deployment status
   - Track performance metrics

4. **Rollback Strategy**
   - Prepare quick rollback plan
   - Document changes for each version
   - Maintain traceability of deployment history
